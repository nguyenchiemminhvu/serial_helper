 * ============================================================
 * Interface Segregation (SOLID – ISP): write-only contract for a
 * serial data sink.
 *
 * Consumers that only need to send data (e.g. a UBX command
 * builder) depend on this narrow interface rather than the full
 * i_serial_port contract.
 *
 * All write methods return the number of bytes actually written,
 * or throw serial_write_error on failure.  A short write (return
 * value < requested) is not an error; it is the caller's
 * responsibility to re-issue the remainder if needed.
