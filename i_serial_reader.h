/**
 * i_serial_reader.h
 * ============================================================
 * Interface Segregation (SOLID – ISP): read-only contract for a
 * serial data source.
 *
 * Consumers that only need to receive data (e.g. a UBX frame
 * decoder) depend on this interface rather than the full
 * i_serial_port, keeping coupling minimal.
 *
 * All read methods return the number of bytes actually read, or
 * throw serial_read_error / serial_timeout_error on failure.
 * A return value of 0 means the timeout elapsed without data
 * (non-error condition when read_timeout_ms > 0).
